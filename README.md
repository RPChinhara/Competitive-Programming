# Competitive-Programming

1. An Automobile Company An automobile company manufactures both a two wheeler (TW) and a four wheeler (FW). A company manager wants to make the production of both types of vehicle according to the given data.
2. Program to check if a year is leap or not.
3. A doctor has a clinic where he serves his patients. The doctor's consultation fees are different for different groups of patients depending on their age. If the patient's age is below 17, fees is 200 INR. If the patient's age is between 17 and 40, fees is 400 INR. If patient's age is above 40, fees is 300 INR. Write a code to calculate earnings in a day for which one array/List of values representing age of patients visited on that day is passed as input.
4. Post Order Traversal in a tree without recursion.
5. Given an array of integers that may contain both positive and negative integers, write a python program to find all pairs whose sum is equal to the desired value.
6. Given an array of n integers where each element represents the maximum length of the jump that can be made forward from that element. This means if array[i] is equal to x, then we can jump any distance y, such that y less than or equal to x. Find the minimum no. of jumps to reach the end of the array starting from the first element. If an element is zero, then you can't move to the next element.
7. Knapsack Greedy Problem (maximise profits)
8. Activity Selection Problem
9. Job Sequencing Problem
10. A party has been organised on cruise. The party is organised for a limited time(T). The number of guests entering (E[i]) and leaving (L[i]) the party at every hour is represented as elements of the array. The task is to find the maximum number of guests present on the cruise at any given instance within T hours.
11. Given an array Arr[] of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array (containing at least one number) which has the maximum sum and return its sum.
12. Given an array A of size N which contains elements from 0 to N-1, you need to find all the elements occurring more than once in the given array. Return the answer in ascending order. If no such element is found, return list containing [-1].
13. Write a program explaining Kadane’s Algorithm in simpler terms.
14. Given head, the head of a singly linked list, find if the linked list is circular or not.
15. Write a Program to reverse the Linked List. (Both Iterative and recursive).
16. Given a binary tree of size N. Your task is to complete the function sumOfLongRootToLeafPath(), that find the sum of all nodes on the longest path from root to leaf node.
17. Given two strings, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them. Both the strings are in uppercase Latin alphabets.
18. Given an undirected graph with V vertices and E edges, check whether it contains any cycle or not.
19. There are given N ropes of different lengths, we need to connect these ropes into one rope. The cost to connect two ropes is equal to the sum of their lengths. The task is to connect the ropes with minimum cost. Given N size array arr[] contains the lengths of the ropes.
20. Given a string. You need to remove all the duplicates from the string. The final output string should contain each character only once. The respective order of the characters inside the string should remain the same. You can only traverse the string at once.
21. Implement Priority Queue.
22. Given an integer K and a queue of integers, we need to reverse the order of the first K elements of the queue, leaving the other elements in the same relative order. 
Only following standard operations are allowed on queue. 
     enqueue(x) : Add an item x to rear of queue 
     dequeue() : Remove an item from front of queue 
     size() : Returns number of elements in queue. 
     front() : Finds front item. 
Note: The above operations represent the general processing’s. In-built functions of the respective languages can be used to solve the problem.
23. Given weights and values of N items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. 
Note: Unlike 0/1 knapsack, you are allowed to break the item. 
24. Solve N-Queens Problem. The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
